//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function car_info(manufacturer, model, keywords, color, feature) {
  let car = {
    manufacturer,
    model,
    keywords,
    color,
    feature,
  };
  return car;
}

let car = car_info("Honda", 2019, ["smooth", "effecient"], "black", "ac");

console.log(car);
